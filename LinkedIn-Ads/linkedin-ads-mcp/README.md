# Quick Install (No Coding Required!)

**Don't want to deal with technical stuff?** Just copy one of the prompts below and paste it into Claude. The AI will do everything for you!

---

## Option 1: Install with Claude Code (Recommended)

If you have [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed, just copy and paste this entire prompt:

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand the Claude Code installation prompt</strong></summary>

```
I want you to install the LinkedIn Ads MCP server so I can analyze my LinkedIn advertising data. Please do the following:

1. FIRST, check if Node.js is installed by running `node --version`. If not installed, tell me to install it from https://nodejs.org first.

2. Clone the repository to my home directory:
   - cd ~
   - git clone https://github.com/danielpopamd/linkedin-ads-mcp.git
   - cd linkedin-ads-mcp

3. Install dependencies and build:
   - npm install
   - npm run build

4. Create the .env file with placeholder values:
   - cp .env.example .env

5. NOW IMPORTANT - Ask me for my LinkedIn API credentials:
   - Ask: "Please provide your LinkedIn Client ID (from https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps)"
   - Ask: "Please provide your LinkedIn Client Secret"

6. Update the .env file with the credentials I provide.

7. Set up Claude Desktop configuration:
   - Read the current Claude Desktop config file:
     - macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
     - Windows: %APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   - Add the linkedin-ads MCP server to mcpServers (merge with existing config if any):
     {
       "mcpServers": {
         "linkedin-ads": {
           "command": "node",
           "args": ["<FULL_PATH_TO>/linkedin-ads-mcp/dist/index.js"],
           "env": {
             "LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID": "<MY_CLIENT_ID>",
             "LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET": "<MY_CLIENT_SECRET>"
           }
         }
       }
     }
   - Replace <FULL_PATH_TO> with the actual path (e.g., /Users/username)
   - Replace the env values with my actual credentials

8. Run the authentication flow:
   - npm run auth
   - This will open my browser - tell me to authorize the app with LinkedIn

9. Tell me to restart Claude Desktop to activate the MCP server.

10. After restart, confirm setup by telling me to ask Claude: "List my LinkedIn ad accounts"

If you don't have my LinkedIn API credentials yet, first explain how to get them:
- Go to https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps
- Create a new app (need a LinkedIn Company Page)
- Go to Products tab and request "Advertising API" access
- Go to Auth tab and add redirect URL: http://localhost:3000/callback
- Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

## API Limits & Best Practices

### LinkedIn API Limits

- **Rate Limit**: 45 million metric values per 5-minute window
- **Response Limit**: Max 15,000 elements per response
- **Metrics per Request**: Max 20 metrics
- **Demographic Data Delay**: 12-24 hours
- **Reach Data**: Max 92-day date range

### Best Practices

1. **Start with account listing** - Always list accounts first to get valid account IDs
2. **Use reasonable date ranges** - Shorter ranges return faster; use 30 days for regular reporting
3. **Be specific with campaigns** - Filter by campaign IDs when you know which campaigns to analyze
4. **Leverage comparisons** - Use the compare tool to quickly identify performance changes

## Development

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run the server (for testing)
npm run dev

# Run authentication flow
npm run auth
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Not authenticated" error

Run `npm run auth` to authenticate with LinkedIn.

### "Rate limited" responses

The server automatically handles rate limits with exponential backoff. If you're hitting limits frequently, reduce the frequency of your requests.

### Token expired

Tokens auto-refresh. If you're still having issues, delete `~/.linkedin-ads-mcp/tokens.json` and re-authenticate with `npm run auth`.

### API access denied

Ensure your LinkedIn Developer app has:
1. The "Advertising API" product approved
2. The correct OAuth scopes enabled (`r_ads`, `r_ads_reporting`)
3. Your user account has access to the ad accounts you're trying to query

### Campaign names showing as "Unknown"

This typically means the campaign ID from analytics doesn't match any campaign in your account. This can happen with archived campaigns or if there's a sync delay.
