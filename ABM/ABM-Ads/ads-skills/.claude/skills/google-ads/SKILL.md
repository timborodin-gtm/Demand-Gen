# Google Ads Management

Orchestrator for all Google Ads tasks. Combines strategic knowledge with programmatic API access for full campaign management.

## Methodology

This skill implements the Ivan Falco B2B demand generation methodology for Google Ads - an intent-first approach that captures existing demand through systematic keyword targeting, proving unit economics before expanding outward.

## Core Philosophy

**Intent is everything. Capture demand before you create it.**

Google Ads is the #1 channel for capturing existing demand. People are actively searching for solutions - your job is to be there at the right moment with the right message. Start with high-intent keywords (brand + solution-aware), prove unit economics, then expand outward to medium/low-intent and awareness.

## Architecture

This skill has two layers:

1. **Knowledge Base** - Strategic frameworks and campaign planning (`knowledge-base/`)
2. **API Scripts** - Programmatic Google Ads management (`scripts/`)

## API Scripts - What You Can Do

All scripts live in `scripts/`. Run from that directory.

**Prerequisites:** Credentials configured in `scripts/.env`. See `api-reference.md` for setup.

### Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| **Account snapshot** | `python account_overview.py --date-range last_30d --compare` |
| **Campaign performance** | `python get_campaign_performance.py --date-range last_7d --by-day` |
| **List campaigns** | `python list_campaigns.py --status ENABLED` |
| **Search terms audit** | `python search_terms_report.py --no-conversions --min-clicks 3` |
| **Keyword performance** | `python get_keyword_performance.py --top 30` |
| **Create campaign** | `python create_campaign.py --name "Brand - Search" --type SEARCH --budget 50` |
| **Update campaign** | `python update_campaign.py --campaign-id <id> --status ENABLED --budget 75` |
| **Create ad group** | `python create_ad_group.py --campaign-id <id> --name "High Intent KWs"` |
| **Create RSA** | `python create_ad.py --ad-group-id <id> --headlines "H1" "H2" "H3" --descriptions "D1" "D2" --final-url "https://..."` |
| **List ads** | `python list_ads.py --campaign-id <id>` |
| **Add keywords** | `python add_keywords.py --ad-group-id <id> --keywords "kw1" "kw2" --match-type PHRASE` |
| **Add negative KWs** | `python add_keywords.py --ad-group-id <id> --keywords "free" "cheap" --negative` |

### Workflow: Analyze an Account

1. Run `python account_overview.py --compare` - get the big picture
2. Identify top-spending campaigns, check ROAS
3. Run `python get_campaign_performance.py --campaign-id <id> --by-day` - daily trends
4. Run `python search_terms_report.py --no-conversions` - find wasted spend
5. Run `python get_keyword_performance.py --campaign-id <id>` - keyword-level analysis
6. Make recommendations: pause underperformers, add negatives, adjust budgets

### Workflow: Build a New Campaign

1. `python create_campaign.py --name "..." --type SEARCH --budget 50 --bidding MAXIMIZE_CONVERSIONS`
2. `python create_ad_group.py --campaign-id <id> --name "..." --cpc-bid 3.00`
3. `python add_keywords.py --ad-group-id <id> --keywords "..." --match-type PHRASE`
4. `python create_ad.py --ad-group-id <id> --headlines "..." --descriptions "..." --final-url "..."`
5. `python update_campaign.py --campaign-id <id> --status ENABLED`

**Safety:** All new campaigns start PAUSED. Enable only after reviewing setup.

## Routing Logic

| User Intent | Route | When to Use |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Account analysis, performance review | Run `account_overview.py` then drill down | "How are my Google Ads doing?" |
| Search term waste | Run `search_terms_report.py --no-conversions` | "Where am I wasting money?" |
| Keyword optimization | Run `get_keyword_performance.py` | "Which keywords are working?" |
| Create new campaign | Use the build workflow above | "Set up a search campaign for..." |
| Pause/enable/budget changes | Run `update_campaign.py` | "Pause this campaign" / "Increase budget" |
| Strategic campaign planning | Load the knowledge base files below | New account, media plan, scaling decision |

## Knowledge Base

Ground all strategy in these files. Read the relevant one before advising.

| File | Contains | Read When |
|------|----------|-----------|
| [intent-first-strategy.md](knowledge-base/intent-first-strategy.md) | Intent ladder (brand -> high-intent -> competitor -> problem-aware -> demand-gen), capture-before-create, B2B realities | Any strategy/planning question, prioritizing spend |
| [account-structure.md](knowledge-base/account-structure.md) | Splitting by intent, themed ad groups (not SKAGs), naming, network/geo defaults, when to consolidate | Setting up or restructuring an account |
| [keyword-and-match-types.md](knowledge-base/keyword-and-match-types.md) | Match type progression, B2B keyword research, negatives, avoiding self-competition | Building keyword lists, choosing match types |
| [bidding-strategy.md](knowledge-base/bidding-strategy.md) | Bidding by conversion volume, tCPA/tROAS, setting/moving targets, the optimize-to-quality trap | Choosing or changing a bid strategy |
| [search-terms-and-negatives.md](knowledge-base/search-terms-and-negatives.md) | Weekly search terms ritual, what to negative, negative match types, shared lists | Weekly optimization, cutting waste |
| [benchmarks-and-measurement.md](knowledge-base/benchmarks-and-measurement.md) | B2B SaaS benchmark ranges, metrics that matter, offline conversion import, weekly scorecard | Performance review, expectations, measurement setup |
| [performance-max-b2b.md](knowledge-base/performance-max-b2b.md) | When/when-not to run PMax, guardrails (brand exclusions, signals, negatives), reading PMax | PMax questions, scaling beyond Search |
| [rsa-and-landing-pages.md](knowledge-base/rsa-and-landing-pages.md) | RSA assets, pinning, writing to intent, landing page message match, Quality Score | Writing ads, improving CVR or Quality Score |
| [cheatsheet-overview.md](knowledge-base/cheatsheet-overview.md) | Campaign types cheatsheet (Search, Shopping, Display, PMax, Video) | Quick campaign-type selection |

## Core Rules

1. **Always start PAUSED.** Never create campaigns in ENABLED state. Review everything before turning on spend.

2. **Check search terms weekly.** The search terms report is the #1 optimization lever. Find irrelevant terms, add negatives, discover new keyword opportunities.

3. **Build bottom-up by intent.** Start with brand + high-intent keywords. Prove they convert. Then expand to medium-intent, then low-intent/awareness.

4. **Match type strategy matters.** Start with Phrase match for control, expand to Broad match only with Smart Bidding and sufficient conversion data (30+ conversions/month).

5. **Quality Score drives costs.** Monitor QS on keywords - low QS means ad relevance or landing page issues. Fix those before increasing bids.

6. **RSA best practices.** 8-10 unique headlines, 3-4 descriptions. Pin critical brand/CTA to position 1. Let Google optimize the rest.

7. **Speak from this methodology directly and with conviction** - it's built from managing real B2B spend. Don't pad with generic "best practices."

## Campaign Types - When to Use What

| Type | Use Case | When |
|------|----------|------|
| Search | High-intent keyword capture | Always - this is your foundation |
| Performance Max | Broad AI-driven across all networks | After Search proves unit economics |
| Display | Remarketing and awareness | Remarketing first, prospecting second |
| Shopping | E-commerce product ads | Product catalog campaigns |
| Video (YouTube) | Brand awareness and remarketing | After core campaigns are profitable |

## Key Metrics to Watch

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|------------------|
| Search Impression Share | How much demand you're capturing |
| Quality Score | Ad + landing page relevance |
| Cost per Conversion | Unit economics |
| ROAS | Revenue efficiency |
| Search Terms (no conv) | Budget waste |
| Top Impression % | Ad position competitiveness |
