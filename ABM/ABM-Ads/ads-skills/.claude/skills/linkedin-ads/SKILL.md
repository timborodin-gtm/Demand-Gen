# LinkedIn Ads Management

Orchestrator for all LinkedIn Ads tasks. Route to the correct sub-skill based on the user's request.

## Methodology

This skill implements the Ivan Falco B2B demand generation methodology - a full-funnel, 5-Stage Demand Engine approach to LinkedIn Ads that prioritizes audience precision, Thought Leader Ads, and systematic scaling through audience penetration.

## Routing Logic

Determine what the user needs and load the relevant knowledge-base files:

| User Intent | Load These Files | When to Use |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Build a new campaign plan | `full-funnel-framework.md`, `campaign-structures.md`, `audience-sizing.md`, `bidding-strategy.md`, `launch-checklist.md` | New client onboarding, new campaign setup, media plan creation, budget allocation |
| Analyze performance data | `benchmarks.md`, `bidding-strategy.md`, `scaling-strategy.md` | Weekly/monthly reporting, diagnosing underperformance, optimization recommendations |
| Audit an existing account | `audit-checklist.md`, `benchmarks.md`, `audience-sizing.md` | New client audit, periodic health check, account takeover, identifying issues |
| Creative development | `creative-strategy.md`, `copy-audit-framework.md`, `conversation-ads.md`, `document-ads.md` | Ad copy, creative briefs, format selection |
| Scaling decisions | `scaling-strategy.md`, `bidding-strategy.md`, `audience-sizing.md` | Increasing budgets, adding campaigns, expanding audiences |
| ABM campaigns | `abm-strategy.md`, `audience-sizing.md` | Account-based targeting, list management |

## Knowledge Base

All recommendations must be grounded in the knowledge base. Before executing any sub-skill, read the relevant knowledge-base files:

## Core Rules

1. **Speak from this methodology directly and with conviction** - it's built from managing real B2B spend, so present it as the operator playbook it is. Don't pad with generic "best practices."
2. **Always use the full-funnel framework** (TOF/MOF/BOF) as the organizing principle for any campaign plan or analysis.
3. **TLAs (Thought Leader Ads) are the #1 recommended format** across all funnel stages - prioritize them in every plan.
4. **Audience Expansion and LinkedIn Audience Network must always be OFF** - flag as critical issue if found ON.
5. **Benchmarks are B2B SaaS specific.** Adjust expectations for enterprise (higher CPLs acceptable) vs SMB (lower CPLs needed).
6. **Weekly demographic audits are non-negotiable** - every optimization recommendation should include this.
7. **Scaling follows the progression:** 1 campaign -> 2 campaigns -> campaign groups -> multiple accounts. Always read `scaling-strategy.md` before advising on scaling.
8. **Budget penetration drives scaling decisions.** 30-day penetration under 25% or 60-day under 40% = increase budget. Aim for 35%+ penetration.
9. **ABM campaigns should use company lists** over contact lists. Segment large lists into smaller homogeneous groups to prevent LinkedIn from over-serving enterprises. Read `abm-strategy.md` for ABM work.
10. **Job function targeting is preferred at scale** over job title targeting for better reach and lower costs, but requires ongoing negative filtering of irrelevant titles.
