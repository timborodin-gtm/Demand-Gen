# Ivan Falco's Ads Skills for Claude Code

**Run your B2B paid motion like an ads engineer.** 40+ strategy files, 39 API scripts, and battle-tested frameworks for LinkedIn, Meta, and Google Ads - built from managing $200K+/month in B2B ad spend across 12+ accounts.

Clone this repo, open Claude Code, and ask it anything about your ads. It knows the strategy, it pulls your live data, and it manages your campaigns.

> **Important:** this runs in **Claude Code on your own computer** - the `claude` CLI in your terminal, or the Claude Code desktop app (Local mode). It does **not** work in the Claude chat app (claude.ai / the Claude desktop chat), which can't run scripts on your machine. New to Claude Code? Install it: https://code.claude.com/docs

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/ivangfalco/ads-skills.git
cd ads-skills

# 2. Open Claude Code
claude

# 3. Run the onboarding (5 minutes)
/onboarding
```

Or skip onboarding and just start asking:

```
"Audit my LinkedIn ad account"
"What's the right budget split for $50K/month?"
"Pull my active Meta ads and review the copy"
"Create a search campaign for our product"
"Which campaigns should I kill and which should I scale?"
```

## How It Works

These skills turn Claude Code into a specialized advertising assistant. Each skill file teaches Claude:

- **What to do** - strategy frameworks, decision trees, benchmarks
- **How to do it** - Python scripts that connect to ad platform APIs
- **When to reference what** - routing logic that loads the right knowledge for the task

The methodology is the Ivan Falco 5-Stage Demand Engine approach - battle-tested across 12+ B2B accounts, $200K+/month in managed spend. When Claude gives you advice through these skills, it's grounded in real campaign data, not generic best practices.
