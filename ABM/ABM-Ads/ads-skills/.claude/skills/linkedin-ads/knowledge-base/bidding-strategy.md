# Bidding Strategy & Weekly Optimization

## Bidding Approach

### Phase 1: Automated (Week 1 of any new campaign)

Start every new campaign with automated/maximum delivery bidding. This lets LinkedIn's algorithm learn who engages and at what cost. Don't touch bids during this phase.

### Phase 2: Manual (Week 2+)

After week 1, switch to manual CPC bidding at **20% below your average CPC** from the automated phase. This works ~99% of the time for significant CPC reductions.

### Exceptions

- **Small retargeting/ABM audiences:** Keep automated bidding - manual bidding on tiny audiences causes underdelivery
- **New campaign objectives:** Reset to automated for the first week when changing objectives
- **Undersized audiences (<10K):** May not spend full budgets regardless of bid amounts

### Bid Strategy by Objective

| Objective | Recommended Bid Type | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Engagement (TOF) | Start automated, switch manual | Optimize for lowest cost per engagement |
| Video Views (TOF) | Automated usually fine | Video views are typically cheap on LinkedIn |
| Website Visits (MOF/BOF) | Start automated, switch manual | Monitor CPC closely |
| Lead Gen Forms (BOF) | Cost cap or manual | Set cap at target CPL |
| Conversions (BOF) | Automated for small audiences, manual for large | Depends on audience size |

## Weekly Optimization Checklist

Most advertisers underestimate the power of weekly demographic audits. Do this every week:

### Step 1: Check Demographics Report

Open Campaign Manager, Demographics tab for each active campaign. Review:
- **Job Title:** Are irrelevant titles consuming budget? Exclude them.
- **Job Function:** Aligned with ICP?
- **Seniority:** Any unpaid/training/entry slipping through? Exclude.
- **Industry:** Are off-target industries showing up? Exclude the ones with impressions but no engagement.
- **Company Size:** Aligned with target?
- **Company Name:** Any competitors showing up? Exclude.

### Step 2: Review Performance Metrics

| Metric | Check | Action if failing |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| CTR (TOF) | Above 0.44% avg? | Refresh creative or widen audience |
| CTR (BOF) | Above 3-5%? | Strengthen CTA or tighten retargeting |
| CPE | Below $5? | Good. Above $5 = review targeting |
| Frequency | Below 3/week per person? | Above 3 = rotate creative or expand audience |
| Audience penetration | Above 10% in first 2 weeks? | Below 10% = audience too large or budget too low |
| Spend pacing | Spending full daily budget? | Underspending = audience too small or bid too low |

### Step 3: Creative Health

- Any ad running for 3+ months? Refresh it
- Are there 4+ active ads per campaign? If not, add more
- Check for creative fatigue: declining CTR over 2+ weeks, rotate
- **Ad rotation scheduling:** New ads should start with even rotation (equal budget per ad). After 7-10 days of data, switch to auto rotation so the algorithm favors winners. This prevents premature "winner" selection before enough data is collected.

### Step 4: Budget Reallocation

- Shift budget from underperforming campaigns to outperformers
- Don't make more than 20% budget changes at once (algorithm needs stability)
- If a campaign has less than 10 results/week, it lacks enough data to optimize

### Step 5: Check Audience Penetration

Review audience penetration data to determine if budgets need adjusting:

| Timeframe | Penetration Threshold | Action |
|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| 30 days | Below 25% of audience | Increase budget |
| 60 days | Below 40% of audience | Increase budget |
| Target | 35%+ penetration | Healthy - maintain |

**Key insight:** Doubling budget typically boosts penetration by 50-70%, not 100%. One well-budgeted campaign at 35%+ penetration outperforms three underfunded campaigns at 12% each.

## Campaign Group Budget Optimization

LinkedIn's group budget feature lets the algorithm allocate budget across campaigns within a group instead of setting individual campaign budgets.

### Test Results ($25M+ Data)

| Metric | Group Budget | Campaign Budget |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Cost per reach | ~10% cheaper | Baseline |
| Audience penetration | Nearly 2x higher | Baseline |
| In-platform metrics (CTR, engagement) | Marginally better (~1%) | Baseline |

**Key finding:** One month's audience penetration with group budget = two months' audience penetration without. The algorithm is better at distributing spend for maximum reach.

### Caveats

- **One objective per group** - can't mix reach + traffic objectives
- **Algorithm favors cheaper audiences** - non-enterprise campaigns get the lion's share of budget in mixed groups
- **Video bias** - if mixing static + video in one group, 80%+ budget may go to video
- **Recommendation:** Be as granular as possible. Don't mix enterprise + SMB campaigns, or static + video campaigns, in the same group

### Budget Approach for New Campaign Types

- **Given extra budget:** Start new campaign at half the original campaign budget, increase in 2 weeks if performance is good ("smoke testing")
- **No extra budget:** Use campaign group budget option, but expect LinkedIn to prioritize the cheapest campaign type

## Ad Scheduling and Rotation Tactics

### LinkedIn Ad Scheduling

LinkedIn's ad day starts at UTC midnight, which is 8:00 PM Eastern. This matters for budget pacing and scheduling.

**Recommended schedule:** Run ads from 5:00 AM to 2:00 PM Eastern (business hours when professionals are most active on LinkedIn). Pause during afternoons and evenings when engagement drops and CPMs remain high.

**Why this works:** LinkedIn's algorithm resets daily budget at UTC midnight. By concentrating spend during peak engagement hours, you get more efficient delivery than spreading budget across 24 hours where much of it is wasted on low-engagement times.

### Ad Rotation Trick for Budget-Limited Accounts

If budget is tight and you need to run 6 campaigns but can only afford $30/day each:

- **Set A (3 campaigns):** Run Monday, Wednesday, Friday
- **Set B (3 campaigns):** Run Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday

This gives each campaign a $30/day budget on its active days, costing $30/day total instead of $60/day to run all six simultaneously. The campaigns still build reach over time, just at a 3-day-per-week pace instead of 7.

**When to use:** Budget-constrained accounts that need to test multiple audiences or creative approaches without doubling their daily spend.

## Sales Alignment and Lead Feedback

### Monthly Sales Alignment Meeting

Hold a monthly meeting between the ads team and sales to review:
- Which leads from LinkedIn are converting into pipeline
- Lead quality feedback by campaign and creative
- Which personas and messages are generating the best conversations
- Upcoming product launches or events to coordinate with ad campaigns

### Automated Lead Alerts via Slack

Set up real-time lead notifications using Zapier (or similar automation):
- When a new lead comes in from LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms, send to dedicated Slack channel
- Include key fields: company name, job title, form responses
- Sales team gives thumbs up (good lead) or thumbs down (bad lead) emoji reactions
- Track thumbs up/down ratio per campaign to measure lead quality over time

This creates a continuous feedback loop between paid ads and sales without requiring manual reporting.

## Monthly Review

- Review full-month ROAS and conversion data
- Assess strategic shifts needed
- Check retargeting pool growth (is TOF feeding the funnel?)
- Evaluate if audience segments need expanding or contracting
- Plan next month's creative rotation

## Quarterly Review

- Full performance audit (use audit-checklist.md)
- Strategy evaluation: is the funnel structure still right?
- Benchmark comparison: are we above/below industry?
- Budget planning for next quarter
