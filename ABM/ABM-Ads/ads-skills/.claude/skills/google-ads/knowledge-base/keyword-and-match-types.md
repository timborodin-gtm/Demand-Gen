# Keywords and Match Types

## Match types, honestly
Match types are looser than their names suggest. Treat them as intent filters, not exact controls.

- **Exact `[keyword]`** - tightest, but still matches close variants, synonyms, and same-intent rephrasings. Highest control, lowest volume. Start here for your money terms.
- **Phrase `"keyword"`** - matches queries with the meaning of your phrase. The workhorse for B2B: enough control, enough reach.
- **Broad `keyword`** - matches anything Google deems related. Only safe with Smart Bidding and a solid conversion signal feeding it. Without that, broad torches budget.

### The progression
1. **Start Phrase + Exact** on high-intent terms. Manual or Maximize Conversions with low volume.
2. **Mine search terms weekly.** Add winners as keywords, add junk as negatives. See [search-terms-and-negatives.md](search-terms-and-negatives.md).
3. **Introduce Broad only after** the account has a real conversion signal (30+ conversions/month) and Smart Bidding is on. Broad + Smart Bidding + tight negatives + good conversion data can outperform - in that exact order. Broad without the rest is how budgets die.

## Keyword research for B2B
- Start from how *buyers* describe the problem, not how *you* describe the product. They search "stop leads going cold", you call it "lead lifecycle automation."
- Pull seed terms from: your own search terms report, sales call language, competitor ad copy, and the Keyword Planner for volume sanity.
- B2B volumes are small. A keyword with 50 searches/month and clear intent beats one with 5,000 searches and mixed intent.
- Tag each keyword by intent tier (brand / high / competitor / problem-aware) so reporting maps to the [intent ladder](intent-first-strategy.md).

## Negative keywords are half the job
B2B Search without aggressive negatives bleeds money. Build from day one:
- **Universal junk**: "free", "cheap", "jobs", "salary", "course", "tutorial", "login" (unless brand), "reddit", "crack", "torrent".
- **Audience mismatch**: "intern", "student", "examples", "templates" (if you sell software, not templates).
- **Category mismatch**: terms that share words but not intent. If you sell "sales engagement", negative out "employee engagement".
Maintain a shared negative list across non-brand campaigns. Review search terms weekly and keep adding.

## Don't compete with yourself
Avoid the same keyword in multiple ad groups/campaigns at the same match type. Use negatives to route each query to exactly one place, or you split data and bid against your own account.
