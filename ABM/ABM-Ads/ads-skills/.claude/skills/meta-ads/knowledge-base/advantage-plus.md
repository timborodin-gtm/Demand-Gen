## What Changed: Andromeda to Advantage+

Meta's Andromeda algorithm (deployed 2024-2025) fundamentally changed how ads are delivered:

- **Before Andromeda:** Manual targeting (interests, job titles, behaviors) was the primary lever. Advertisers controlled who saw ads.
- **After Andromeda:** Creative quality and conversion signals matter more than targeting. The algorithm finds your audience if your creative resonates and your tracking is clean.

**What this means for B2B:** The game shifted from "who do I target" to "what creative do I feed the algorithm, and what conversion data do I send back."

Advantage+ is Meta's product layer built on Andromeda. It automates targeting, placements, creative optimization, and budget allocation.

## The Four Layers of Advantage+

### 1. Advantage+ Audience
- Your custom audiences and lookalikes become **suggestions**, not hard limits
- Meta's algorithm expands beyond your defined audiences if it predicts better performance
- You can still provide: Custom Audiences, Lookalike Audiences, Detailed Targeting as starting points
- Meta uses your inputs to **learn patterns**, then finds similar users on its own

### 2. Advantage+ Placements
- Automatic placement optimization across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Audience Network
- Meta selects best-performing placements dynamically
- Manual placement selection still available but Meta pushes automation

### 3. Advantage+ Creative
- AI-powered creative variations from your uploaded assets
- Tests combinations of backgrounds, text overlays, aspect ratios
- Adjusts creative per placement and audience segment

### 4. Advantage+ Campaigns (Full Automation)
- **Advantage+ Sales** (formerly Shopping) - for conversion-optimized campaigns
- **Advantage+ Leads** (launched February 2025) - specifically for B2B lead gen
- **Advantage+ App** - for app installs
- Fully automated: targeting, budget allocation, creative optimization, placements

## Advantage+ Leads (The B2B Feature)

Launched globally February 2025, designed for lead generation with B2B-specific features:

- **Work email validation** - require business email addresses on lead forms
- **SMS verification** - verify phone numbers to reduce fake leads
- **Lead filtering** - pre-qualify leads before they submit
- **10% lower cost per qualified lead** in Meta's early testing

This is Meta's answer to the "lead quality is terrible on Meta" problem for B2B.

## When to Use Advantage+ vs Manual for B2B

### Use Advantage+ When:
- You have **50+ conversions per week** (algorithm needs data to optimize)
- Budget is **$2,000+/month** (minimum for testing; $5,000+ for reliable results)
- You have **strong conversion tracking** (Pixel + CAPI both firing)
- Goal is **scaling proven offers** (not testing new ones)
- You have **diverse creative assets** (3-5+ variations for the algorithm to test)
- You're running **broad prospecting** (not tight ABM)

### Use Manual Campaigns When:
- **Early testing** with new offers, audiences, or creative concepts
- Conversion volume is **low** (< 50/week) - common with niche B2B or $100K+ ACV
- You need **strict audience control** (ABM against named accounts)
- You need **granular reporting** by segment
- Running **top-of-funnel awareness** (video views, engagement - Advantage+ is lower-funnel focused)
- **Limited creative** (< 3 variations - algorithm needs variety)

### The Hybrid Approach (Recommended for B2B SaaS)

```
Manual Campaigns (ABO) - "Where You Learn"
  Audience validation tests (separate ad sets per audience)
  New creative concept testing
  Top-of-funnel awareness (video views, engagement)
  ABM retargeting (specific accounts)
  Use Ad Set Budget for control

Advantage+ Campaigns (CBO) - "Where You Earn"
  Scale proven offers with best-performing creative
  Lower-funnel conversions (leads, demos, trials)
  Let Meta optimize for volume + quality
  Use Campaign Budget Optimization
```

**Transition trigger:** Once you have a winning offer + winning audience + 50+ conversions/week, move to Advantage+ for scale.

## Setting Up Advantage+ Leads (Step by Step)

1. **Ads Manager > Create > Leads objective** (auto-defaults to Advantage+)
2. **Conversion location:** Website (Pixel + CAPI) or Instant Forms (recommended for mobile)
3. **Budget:** Set at campaign level (CBO) - minimum = (Target CPA x 50) / 7 days
4. **Audience:** Provide suggestions (custom audiences, lookalikes, detailed targeting) - Meta treats as starting points, not limits
5. **Demographics:** Set location (required). Only use "Further Limit Reach" for age/gender if you have DATA showing certain segments don't convert.
6. **Creative:** Upload 3-5+ variations. Enable Advantage+ Creative for auto-variations.
7. **Lead Form setup:**
   - Use **Higher Intent** form type
   - Require **work email** (Advantage+ Leads feature)
   - Add **1-3 custom qualification questions**
   - Enable **SMS verification** if available
8. **Launch > Wait 7 days > Monitor Campaign Score (aim for 70+)**

## Budget Requirements

### Minimum to Exit Learning Phase

| Target CPA | Minimum Daily Budget | Weekly Budget |
|------------|---------------------|---------------|
| $20 | $143/day | $1,000/week |
| $50 | $357/day | $2,500/week |
| $100 | $714/day | $5,000/week |

**Formula:** (50 conversions x Target CPA) / 7 days = Minimum Daily Budget

### B2B Reality Check
Most B2B SaaS with $30K+ ACV won't hit 50 conversions/week on demos or meetings. **Workarounds:**
- Optimize for **upper-funnel events** first (lead form submissions, landing page views)
- Use **lead magnets** (higher volume) to feed the algorithm, then retarget converters toward demos
- Send **MQL events** via CAPI to train the algorithm on qualified leads, not just raw form fills
- **Consolidate ad sets** - one large ad set with more budget > multiple small ones

## Advantage+ and Custom Audiences / Lookalikes

**Key concept:** In Advantage+ mode, all audiences are **suggestions**.

- Upload CRM lookalike as audience - Meta uses it as a starting signal, then expands
- Upload retargeting audience - Meta serves to them first, then finds similar users
- There's no way to "lock" Advantage+ to a specific audience

**Advantage Custom Audience:** Dynamically expands beyond your list if algorithm predicts better performance. You cannot turn off expansion in Advantage+ mode.

**Advantage Lookalike Audience:** Expands beyond your defined percentage (e.g., set 1% and Meta may go to 3-5% if results hold).

**Test results (2025):** Advantage+ Audience delivered 33% lower cost per result vs. manual targeting. However, for niche B2B, Original Audience mode sometimes wins on lead quality despite higher cost.

---

## Advantage+ for ABM: Mostly No

**Advantage+ conflicts with ABM because:**
- ABM requires targeting **specific named accounts**
- Advantage+ treats all audiences as suggestions and **expands beyond them**
- No way to "lock" audience to your account list

**Options for ABM:**

| Approach | How | Trade-off |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| **Original Audience (manual)** | Turn off Advantage+ Audience, upload custom list, disable expansion | Full ABM control, gives up automation |
| **Hybrid** | Advantage+ for broad prospecting, manual for ABM retargeting | Best of both, more campaigns to manage |
| **ABM-lite with suggestions** | Upload TAL as Advantage+ suggestion, accept expansion | Some ABM influence, but Meta will go broad |
| **"Further Limit Reach"** | Apply hard filters (job title, industry) in Advantage+ | Reduces reach, slows learning, often hurts performance |

**Recommendation:** Use **manual campaigns for true ABM** (named accounts, acceleration). Use **Advantage+ for broad prospecting** where you want scale and lower CPL. Don't try to force ABM into Advantage+.

## "Further Limit Reach" - When to Use

This setting applies hard demographic filters in Advantage+ campaigns. Meta discourages it because it reduces the algorithm's ability to optimize.

**Use it ONLY when:**
- You have data showing certain segments never convert (e.g., age 18-24 produces zero B2B leads)
- Compliance or legal requirements demand restrictions
- You've tested broad and confirmed specific segments waste budget

**Don't use it when:**
- You're guessing about audience fit
- Cold account with no conversion history
- Budget is tight (can't afford slower learning phase)
- You haven't tested broad first

**Default for B2B:** Location + age 25-65. Let creative do the filtering ("For B2B SaaS founders managing $100K+ in ad spend").

---

## Campaign Score

Meta now shows a Campaign Score (0-100) that grades how well you follow their recommendations. For B2B:
- **70+:** Good - campaigns follow best practices
- **50-70:** Room for improvement - likely over-constraining targeting or under-feeding creative
- **< 50:** Significant issues - may be fighting the algorithm

Increasing your Campaign Score typically means: more creative variety, broader targeting, Advantage+ features enabled, higher budget relative to CPA.

**Don't blindly optimize for Campaign Score.** A score of 60 with good lead quality beats 90 with junk leads. Quality > automation compliance.

## Performance Data (What We Know So Far)

| Metric | Manual Campaigns | Advantage+ | Improvement |
|--------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| Cost per result | Baseline | -33% lower (Meta data, 2023) | Significant |
| ROAS | 1.60 median (B2B SaaS) | +22% improvement | Meaningful |
| CBO vs ABO | Baseline (ABO) | -12% cost per conversion (CBO) | Moderate |
| Advantage+ Leads CPL | Baseline | -10% lower (Meta early testing) | Early data |

**Caveat:** Most published data is Meta's own testing. Independent B2B-specific case studies for Advantage+ Leads are limited (feature is new - launched Feb 2025). Test in your accounts before committing.
