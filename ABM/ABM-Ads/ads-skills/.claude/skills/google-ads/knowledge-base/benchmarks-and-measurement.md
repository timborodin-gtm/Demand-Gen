# Benchmarks and Measurement

Benchmarks are for sanity checks and setting expectations, not targets to copy. Your category, ACV, and sales motion move these a lot. Use them to spot something obviously broken, then optimize against your own trend.

## B2B SaaS Search benchmarks (rough ranges)

| Metric | Brand | Non-brand high-intent | Competitor |
|--------|-------|----------------------|------------|
| CTR | 8-20% | 2-6% | 1.5-4% |
| CVR (click -> lead) | 15-40% | 3-10% | 2-6% |
| CPC | low | $8-40+ (category-dependent) | often higher than non-brand |
| CPL | low | $80-400+ | higher |

Ranges are wide on purpose. A $50K-ACV security product and a $400/yr SMB tool live at opposite ends. Anchor to *your* first 30 days, then improve.

## The metrics that actually matter in B2B
Watch these over vanity clicks/impressions:
- **Search Impression Share** - how much of available demand you're capturing. Low IS on profitable terms = leave money on the table; raise budget/bids.
- **Search Lost IS (budget)** vs **(rank)** - tells you whether you're capped by money or by Ad Rank. Different fixes.
- **Cost per qualified lead / per SQL** - not cost per form fill. This is the real number.
- **Quality Score** (keyword level) - 1-10; low QS means ad relevance, expected CTR, or landing page experience is weak. Fix those before raising bids; higher QS lowers CPC.

## Measurement: the B2B problem
In-platform "conversions" are last-click and immediate. B2B deals close in 60-180 days. If you optimize only to what Google sees at click time, you optimize for form fills, not pipeline.

Fix it in this order:
1. **Define conversions by quality**, not just form submits. A demo request and a newsletter signup are not the same conversion.
2. **Import offline conversions** - push SQL/opportunity/closed-won back to Google (via GCLID + offline import, or a CRM integration). Now Smart Bidding learns toward revenue.
3. **Value them** - assign deal/pipeline values so value-based bidding can work.
4. **Report on pipeline**, and reconcile platform numbers against the CRM monthly. When they disagree, the CRM wins.

## A clean weekly scorecard
Spend, leads, CPL, lead->SQL rate (from CRM), SQLs, cost/SQL, Search IS, and top wasted search terms. If those eight are healthy and trending right, the account is healthy. Everything else is detail.
